## 5. Set Access Policy

Access policies define how data consumers can request and gain access to this product.

> âœ… You must **configure access policies while the data product is in draft**.

To configure the policy:

1. Open your draft data product.
2. Click **Manage policies**.

Within the policy editor:

- Under **Permitted access**, define usage purposes (e.g. "Marketing Analytics", "Operational Insights").
- Under **Approval requirements**, choose:
  - Whether manager or privacy review is required.
  - Approvers (can be users, Entra ID groups, etc.)
  - Optional: Set an **Access provider** to manually grant access to data assets.
- Under **Attestations**, configure whether data copies are allowed, terms of use, and other acknowledgements.

> ðŸ‘€ **Preview the request form**  
> Before saving, you can select **Preview request form** to see what users will experience when they request access to your data product. This helps validate that your configuration is clear and complete.

ðŸ“¸ * TODO Insert screenshot of policy settings and preview window*

Click **Save changes** when done.

- Metadata (basic + use case),
- Data assets attached,
- A defined access policy,

...you can publish it.
