# Module 4 - Curating Data Assets

[< Previous Module](../modules/module03.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Module >](../modules/module05.md)

**‚è∞ Duration:** 20 minutes

**üéØ Outcome:** At the end of this task, you will have curated a sample of data assets from scans configured in [Module 3](). These assets will be enriched with descriptions, tags, classifications, and other metadata, providing additional context for end users to better consume and understand the data.

## :loudspeaker: Introduction

Once sources have been registered and scanned, the underlying catalog will begin to populate with assets that represent real-world objects (e.g. a table in an Azure SQL Database, a Power BI report, etc.) 

Data curation involves systematically organizing and managing data assets to ensure they are of high quality, accurate, and reliable. This process includes enhancing the data for presentation by adding metadata such as descriptions, tags, classifications, lineage information, etc. making the data more discoverable and usable for end users.

Given that data is generated across various areas of a business, it is crucial to consider the curation lifecycle before initiating the process. In this module, you'll learn the importance of data curation, including the process involved in organizing and managing data assets to ensure their quality, accuracy, and reliability. With this, you will learn how to enrich data with metadata such as descriptions, tags, classifications, lineage information, and owners, making the data more discoverable and usable for end users.

## :thinking: Prerequisites

* An [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) with an active subscription.
* A Microsoft Purview account (see [module 00](../modules/module00.md)).
* A completed scan on registered Data Sources (see [module 02](../modules/module02.md)).

## :dart: Objectives

* Search Unified Catalog for Data Assets.
* Browse by source.
* Update an existing data asset.

## 1. Search Unified Catalog

1. Open the **Microsoft Purview Governance Portal**, navigate to **Unified Catalog** > **Discovery** > **Data assets**, type the asterisk character (**\***) into the search bar, and hit **Enter**.

    ![Discovery](../images/module04/M4.01.png)

2. Filter the search results by **Data Source type** (e.g. **Azure SQL DB**), and click the hyperlinked asset name to view the details (e.g. `Customer`).

> While the **Microsoft Purview Governance Portal** is provided as the default user experience, customers and partners can interface with the underlying platform using the [Microsoft Purview REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/purview/). The openness of the platform enables the possibility of integrating Microsoft Purview with custom user interfaces as well as the ability to perform read/write operations programmatically.

## 2. Edit/Update an Asset

1. Click **Edit** to modify the asset details.

    ![Edit Asset](../images/module04/M4.003.png)
   
3. Update the **Description** by copying and pasting the sample text below.

    ```text
    The "Customer" table contains detailed information about customers. This table provides essential details about customers, including their contact information and the associated salesperson, which can be useful for customer relationship management and sales analysis.
    ```

    ![Update Description](../images/module04/M4.004.png)

4. Assign a **Classification** (e.g. `All Full Names`) using the drop-down menu.

    ![Update Classification](../images/module04/M4.05.png)
   
    > :bulb: **Did you know?**
    >
    > Microsoft Purview automatically applies **classifications** to some assets during the scanning process, but there are some scenarios when you may want to manually apply more classifications. For example, Microsoft Purview doesn't automatically apply classifications to table assets (only their columns), or you might want to apply custom classifications.

6. Navigate to the **Schema** tab and update the **Asset description** for each column using the sample text below.

    > :bulb: **Did you know?**
    >
    > **Classifications** and **Glossary Terms** can be assigned at the asset level (e.g. a Table within a Database) as well as at the schema level (e.g. a Column within a Table Schema).

    ![Update Schema](../images/module04/M4.06.png)

    **Customer ID**

    ```text
    Customer identification number.
    ```

    **Name Style**

    ```text
    Preferred customer name. If FALSE, it is unspecified.
    ```

     **Rowguid**

    ```text
    Value used as an identifier of customer record.
    ```

7. Navigate to the **Contacts** tab and set someone within your organization to be an **Expert** and an **Owner**. Click **Save**.

    > :bulb: **Did you know?**
    >
    > Assets can be related to two different types of contacts:
    >
    > * **Experts** are often business process or subject matter experts.
    > * Where as **Owners** are often senior executives or business area owners that define governance or business processes over certain data areas.
    >
    > For assets in which you are tagged as a **Contact**, these will appear on the home screen (Data catalog), under **My items**.

8. To see other assets within the same path, navigate to the **Related** tab.

    ![Related Assets](../images/module04/M4.08.png)

9. Let's add a few tags to the data asset. Click on **Add Tag**, and type in the following: **Customer**, **Customer_Contact**, **Customer_Information**

## 3. Bulk Edit

Microsoft Purview allows us to perform certain operations (add/replace/remove) against a subset of attributes (Expert, Owner, Term, Classification, Certified) in bulk directly within the Microsoft Purview Governance Portal.

1. Open the **Microsoft Purview Governance Portal**, navigate to **Unified Catalog** > **Discovery** > **Data assets**, type the asterisk character (**\***) into the search bar, and hit **Enter**.

    ![Discovery](../images/module04/M4.01.png)
